# Carbon Neutrality-driven Data Center Energy Management and Job Scheduling System

When we use e-commerce, large language models, cloud computing, and other services in our daily life, it is data centers around the world that complete the data processing and computation jobs. Given the rapid growth of these businesses, data centers are at the forefront of digitalization's energy consumption and carbon emissions challenges.

Renewable energy from sources such as wind and solar power is one key solution to the challenge, but its power will vary at different locations and times. We have developed a Carbon Neutrality-driven Data Center Energy Management and Job Scheduling System to leverage transfer flexibility in many computing tasks. This system enables the transfer of computing tasks to times and locations with more abundant renewable energy generation or lower electricity prices, aiming to reduce the carbon footprint and energy costs of data centers and contribute to the integration of renewable energy into data center operations.

Our approach has been applied and verified in Alibaba's data centers.In April 2022, we successfully achieved the first collaborative scheduling between data centers and the power system by transferring computing tasks from a data center in Jiangsu province to another data center in Hebei province, taking advantage of the regional differences in renewable energy generation. In doing so, our system realized clear carbon emission reductions.

Our project has been reported globally, including in IEEE IAS Magazine and by China's national news agency. The system has received honors such as the Geneva International Patent Award, the First Prize in the UNIDO Global Call and Best Paper in China Computational Power Conference, providing an innovative and replicable solution for the low-carbon operation of data centers. The achievements have also been included in Alibaba's 2023 ESG Report.
