# Carbon Neutrality-driven Data Center Energy Management and Job Scheduling System

When we use e-commerce, large language models, cloud computing, and other services in our daily life, it is data centers around the world that complete the data processing and computation jobs. Given the rapid growth of these businesses, data centers are at the forefront of digitalization's energy consumption and carbon emissions challenges.

Renewable energy from sources such as wind and solar power is one key solution to the challenge, but its power will vary at different locations and times. We have developed a Carbon Neutrality-driven Data Center Energy Management and Job Scheduling System to leverage transfer flexibility in many computing tasks. This system enables the transfer of computing tasks to times and locations with more abundant renewable energy generation or lower electricity prices, aiming to reduce the carbon footprint and energy costs of data centers and contribute to the integration of renewable energy into data center operations.

Our approach has been applied and verified in Alibaba's data centers.In April 2022, we successfully achieved the first collaborative scheduling between data centers and the power system by transferring computing tasks from a data center in Jiangsu province to another data center in Hebei province, taking advantage of the regional differences in renewable energy generation. In doing so, our system realized clear carbon emission reductions.

Our project has been reported globally, including in IEEE IAS Magazine and by China's national news agency. The system has received honors such as the Geneva International Patent Award and the First Prize in the UNIDO Global Call, providing an innovative and replicable solution for the low-carbon operation of data centers.

In terms of industry recognition, the above research achievements have supported Alibaba Cloud data centers in winning awards in various green and low-carbon practice evaluations conducted by national ministries and industry organizations. Data centers that have implemented our solution have received prestigious awards, including the "2022 Dual Transformation Collaborative Typical Cases" award from the Cyberspace Administration of China and recognition among the "Top Ten Outstanding Cases for National Carbon Neutrality."

The project has received funding from National Key Research and Development Program, the National Natural Science Foundation programs of China. It has also received funding from Alibaba for the CCF-AIR project. Our solution has been featured in esteemed journals like IEEE TIA and Applied Energy. Moreover, it has yielded multiple national invention patents.
