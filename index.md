# Carbon Neutrality-driven Data Center Energy Management and Job Scheduling System

When we use e-commerce, large language models and other services in our daily life, data centers undertake the data processing and computation jobs. However, with the rapid growth of these businesses, data centers face significant challenges in energy consumption and carbon emissions.
We developed a Carbon Neutrality-driven Data Center Energy Management and Job Scheduling System, which enables the transfer of computing tasks to the time and location with higher renewable energy generation or lower electricity prices, reducing the carbon footprint and energy costs and promote renewable energy integration.

In 2022, we achieved carbon emission reduction by transferring computing tasks from a data center in Jiangsu to another data center in Hebei, marked the world's first coordinated scheduling between data center and power system.

## Implementation

In 2022, Alibaba Data Center and the State Grid Corporation of China have successfully implemented and validated our method. In April 2022, we achieved a groundbreaking milestone by achieving the world's first collaborative scheduling between data centers and the power system, resulting in a reduction in carbon emissions through the scheduling of data center computing power. These accomplishments garnered media attention from Xinhua News Agency.
