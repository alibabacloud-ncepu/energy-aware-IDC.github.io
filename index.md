# Descrption

When we use e-commerce, large language models and other services in our daily life, data centers undertake the data processing and computation jobs. However, with the rapid growth of these businesses, data centers face significant challenges in energy consumption and carbon emissions.
We developed a Carbon Neutrality-driven Data Center Energy Management and Job Scheduling System, which enables the transfer of computing tasks to the time and location with higher renewable energy generation or lower electricity prices, reducing the carbon footprint and energy costs and promote renewable energy integration.

In 2022, we achieved carbon emission reduction by transferring computing tasks from a data center in Jiangsu to another data center in Hebei, marked the world's first coordinated scheduling between data center and power system.

## Recognition

> This project has achieved numerous research and practical results and has gained wide recognition internationally. 

Research Achievements:

(1) In terms of research outcomes, the project has received funding from National Key Research and Development Program, the National Natural Science Foundation programs of China, and international collaborative projects on "Green Cloud Computing." It has also received funding from Alibaba for the CCF-AIR project and research-oriented internships. Our solution has received funding from national-level initiatives such as the National Natural Science Foundation of China and has been featured in esteemed journals like IEEE TIA and Applied Energy. Moreover, it has yielded multiple national invention patents. 

(2) In terms of industry recognition, the innovative achievements and practical implementations have received honors such as the Global First Prize in the United Nations Industrial Development Organization Global Call, the Best Academic Paper at the China Computational Power Conference organized and the Geneva International Patent Award. The achievements have also been included in Alibaba 's 2023 ESG Report.

2.Practical Implementation:

(1) In terms of implementation, in 2022, Alibaba Data Center and the State Grid Corporation of China have successfully implemented and validated our method. In April 2022, we achieved a groundbreaking milestone by achieving the world's first collaborative scheduling between data centers and the power system, resulting in a reduction in carbon emissions through the scheduling of data center computing power. These accomplishments garnered media attention from Xinhua News Agency.

(2) In terms of industry recognition, the above research achievements have supported Alibaba Cloud data centers in winning awards in various green and low-carbon practice evaluations conducted by national ministries and industry organizations. Data centers that have implemented our solution have received prestigious awards, including the "2022 Dual Transformation Collaborative Typical Cases" award from the Cyberspace Administration of China and recognition among the "Top Ten Outstanding Cases for National Carbon Neutrality."
